The file "example_ebm_vs_linear_vs_decisiontree.ipynb" contains a comparison between three different methods applied to the same problem:
training a model on a training set of central subhalos extracted from IllustrisTNG100 simulation to predict the mass of dark matter in subhalos of a test set.

The three methods compared are:
- Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
